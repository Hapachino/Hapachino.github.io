        Welcome – I’m so glad you could make it. Today we’ll be learning how to integrate 
        <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">The New York Times API</a> into a website. This tutorial

    <h2 class="page-header">Before we get started</h2>

    <p>
    This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of computers and the
    internet, as well as HTML and JavaScript. If not, <a href="http://htmldog.com/">
    HTML Dog</a> has some great beginner tutorials on both 
    <a href ="http://htmldog.com/guides/html/">HTML</a> 
    and <a href="http://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/">Javascript</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="page-header" id="1">What is an API</h2>
    <p>
        Humans have a fairly standard social etiquette for communicating with one
        another. A greeting indicates interest in initiating a conversation, timing
        and tonality help clarify information requested or provided, and a farewell
        signifies the end of an interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Computers and programs have similar rules for talking to one another. An
        API, or Application Programming Interface, defines this set of protocols
        for communication between software components.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will be going over web API’s in particular, which specify the
        interaction between a client and a server. In general terms, a client is a
        computer or program requesting resources, while a server “serves” clients
        by providing said resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        These resources range from simple data to more complex functionality. Its
        transfer is what creates the connectivity that you likely experience every
        day through various apps and webpages.
    </p>

    <h2 class="page-header" id="2">What is JSON</h2>
    <p>
        The transferred data is usually structured in either XML (Extensible Markup
        Language) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). We will be using the more
        popular JSON, which is easier to read and requires less text.
    </p>
    <p>
        It follows the basic format of key-value pairs like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>{ “firstName”: “Isaac”, “lastName”: “Newton” }</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        The entire expression represents an object. The keys “firstName” and
        “lastName” represent attributes while “Isaac” and “Newton” specify the
        corresponding values.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2 class="page-header" id="3">The New York Times API</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        The New York Times was founded over a century ago and its printed version
        has the second highest circulation in the US. <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">
        The New York Times API</a> not only provides access to its articles, but 
        also a wide array of relatedinformation and other insights.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is offered as eleven distinct API categories. We will be focusing on the
        <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json">Article Search API</a>, 
        which provides database access to one of the most
        reliable source of news articles dating back to 1851.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2 class="page-header" id="4">Registering for an API Key</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        Many API’s require keys to make requests which identify the origin and
        ensure its services aren’t being abused.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyone can register for a New York Times API key by <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/signup"
        >signing up</a>. 

    </p>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/signup.png">
    <p>
        You should receive an email soon
        after with your key, which is similar to a username and password and should
        not by shared with anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most API’s have a limit to prevent abuse and the Article Search API by
        default is limited to 1000 calls/day, and 1 call/second.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2 class="page-header" id="5">API Console</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that you have your very own API key, we can finally get to the fun part
        – making requests. To help us quickly get a sense of its functionality, The
        New York Times API has provided us with a <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json#/Console/GET/articlesearch.json">
        console</a> for easily testing out
        various requests and viewing responses. We’ll use this to quickly test
        things before integrating into a webpage.
    </p>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/console.png">
    <p>
        First, copy and paste your newly acquired API key into the “apikey” field.
        As mentioned, The New York Times API requires the use of a key for every
        request. You should now see the response on the right-hand side showing a
        list of the latest articles. The format should look familiar – it’s in JSON
        as we talked about earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let’s go over all the optional parameters specific to the Article
        Search API – these tell the server exactly what information we are
        requesting.
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>q</dt>
    <dd>Search query term</dd>

    <dt>fq</dt>
    <dd>Filtered search query – allows us to narrow our search using a wide
        array of criteria such as source and subject.</dd>

    <dt>begin_date</dt>
    <dd>Filters by publication starting on or after specified date in
        YYYYMMDD format.</dd>

    <dt>end_date</dt>
    <dd>Filters by publication ending on or before specified date in
        YYYYMMDD format.</dd>
        
    <dt>sort</dt>
    <dd>Sorts by date. Possible values are newest and oldest.</dd>

    <dt>fl</dt>
    <dd>Only return specified fields.</dd>

    <dt>hl</dt>
    <dd>Highlights the search term if set to true.</dd>

    <dt>page</dt>
    <dd>Specifies which page of results - 10 results are returned per
        response.</dd>

    <dt>facet_field</dt>
    <dd>Returns a count of the top five terms specified by the query.</dd>

    <dt>facet_filter</dt>
    <dd>By default, the facet counts ignore filters. Setting to true
        limits the counts according to the specified filters.</dd>
    
    </dl>
    <p>
        Try playing around with different values. The response on the right should
        be fairly straight forward. If you get a status code above 400, there
        should be an error message in the response telling you exactly what went
        wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
        And that’s basically it. Well, almost.
    </p>
    <p>
        We don’t want to be limited to using the console to make requests. The
        beauty of an API is that it allows us to integrate its functionality into
        our own webpages and apps.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2 class="page-header" id="6">Request Format</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        The console was fun, but we can’t rely on it to build a webpage or app.
        Fortunately, everything that can be done with the console can be done
        without it. Let’s build a sample request both with and without the console.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many request methods, with GET being the most common and is
        generally used when simply requesting resources. As shown in the API
        documentation, the Article Search API also uses a GET method.
    </p>
    <a href ="http://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json"><img class="thumbnail" src="img/GET.png"></a>
    <p>
        Each GET request is sent to an endpoint, which specifies the location to
        access resources via the API. Appended to the endpoint is our query string.
        It begins with a <code>?</code>, and is composed of the API key and parameters which
        tell the server what information we are looking for. Like JSON, it is
        formatted in key value pairs, each separated by a <code>&amp;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Putting everything together – here’s what a typical GET request looks like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>endpoint?api-key=your-api-key&amp;key-1=value-1&amp;key-2=value-2&amp;key-n=value-n</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Back to our example. Here are the parameters we’ll be using:
    </p>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/parameters.png"> 
    <p>
        If you scroll up to Sample Code, you’ll see the exact same parameters. The
        URL is the endpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let’s convert what we’ve inputted in the console into a standard GET
        request:
    </p>
 
    <pre><code>https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?api-key=0b8bb4e0f6ef4e6cb68cc6c1274e2c83&amp;q=elon%20musk&amp;begin_date=20170401&amp;end_date=20170430&amp;sort=newest&amp;hl=true&amp;page=3&amp;facet_field=source&amp;facet_filter=true</code></pre>

    <p>
        It might look long and confusing at first glance, but if you carefully look
        for the endpoint and parameters, it’s actually very straightforward. You
        may have noticed that the space between elon and musk has been replaced
        with <code>%20</code>. This is in accordance with percent-encoding, which replaces
        special characters with <code>%</code> followed by its ASCII value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2 class="page-header" id="7">Response Format</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        The response you should see within the console should look like this:
    </p>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/response.png"> 
    <p>
        As you can see from the scrollbar length, the response is rather long. And
        even though it’s fairly well formatted, it’s still a little difficult to
        see the bigger picture and make sense of what’s going on. We can do better.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let’s try sending our previous GET request by pasting it in the browser
        as you would a normal web address. You should see something like this in
        response:
    </p>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/unformatted.png"> 
    <p>
        What’s that? You can’t read the response like Neo decoding the Matrix?
        That’s understandable – turns out the console automatically formatted the
        response which is why everything looked so neat before. Fortunately,
        there’s a plethora of JSON formatters online that makes interpreting a much
        more pleasant experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don’t have a favorite, I quite like one called <a href="http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/">
        JSON Editor Online</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Copy the response text and paste it in the left hand side and click the
        convert button. You should see this:
    </p>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/formatted.png"> 
    <p>
        Much better. Now we can clearly see that we received an object with 3
        properties – <code>response</code>, <code>status</code>, and <code>copyright</code>. Like a folder directory, we
        can further expand the properties. <code>response</code> opens up to <code>meta</code>, <code>docs</code>, and
        <code>facets</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>meta</code> contains some useful meta information. In particular, <code>hits</code> displays
        the number of articles fitting our criteria, and <code>offset</code> indicates how many
        results are before the current page.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <code>facets</code> we see that all these articles came from three sources – The New
        York Times, Reuters, and AP.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the brackets, we can tell that <code>docs</code> is an array containing the ten
        results on the current page. Let’s expand the first result:
    </p>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/first_doc.png"> 
    <p>
        There’s a lot of useful information here – let’s go over just a few. Let’s
        start with the <code>web_url</code> – pasting it in the browser actually takes us to the
        original article. The <code>snippet</code> contains our query term “elon musk” that has
        been bolded since we set <code>hl</code> to <code>true</code>. We see that <code>multimedia</code> 
        is also an array containing the source of three images:
    </p>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/multimedia.png"> 
    <p>
        Appending the addresses to <code>http://www.nytimes.com/</code> takes us to
        those images – here’s the second one:
    </p>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/image.png"> 
    <p>
        Looks like we have all we need to make a simple news site.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2 class="page-header" id="8">Creating a simple news site</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal is finally in sight – we have learned everything necessary to
        utilize an API to quickly create websites with powerful functionality. We know
        the format of the request and response, now we just need to figure out how
        to use JavaScript to do so dynamically.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before we start, let’s think about what features our website should
        include.
    </p>
    <p>
        For our example, let’s allow the user to select the following parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Search query term
        </li>
        <li>
            Begin date
        </li>
        <li>
            End date
        </li>
        <li>
            Sort
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition, we’ll also include buttons for moving between pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for output to the webpage, let’s include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Web URL
        </li>
        <li>
            Headline
        </li>
        <li>
            Snippet
        </li>
        <li>
            Publication date
        </li>
        <li>
            Images
        </li>
    </ul>

    <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/Hapachino/ekaeth0m/5/embedded/js/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p>
        First we create an instance of an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object, which
        allows us to send and receive data with a server – The New York Times API
        in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>encodeURIComponent</code> helps encode our search term in case of
        spaces and other reserved characters. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We initialize our request with the <code>open</code> method. The first
        argument is <code>GET</code> since that is the request method we’ll be
        using. Next is the URL we concatenated with the endpoint and parameters. We
        set the last to <code>true</code> to indicate we’ll be making an
        asynchronous request, meaning the program will continue executing while
        waiting for a response.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally we <code>send</code> out our request and pass <code>null</code>
        since we don’t need to send any other information in the request body.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s a good start but we can’t expect users to interact with the JavaScript
        directly. Let’s build a form in html where they can select the parameter
        values.
    </p>

    <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/Hapachino/xduxrkew/11/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p>
        Not bad – the form may not look perfect but we could fix that with a more
        sophisticated stylesheet later on. More importantly, this simple form gives
        users the ability to define parameters and send an actual request.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to creating a form, we also added some additional
        functionality. We placed our previous JavaScript snippet within
        <code>bindButtons</code>, which is called after the HTML loads and adds an
        event listener to the <code>submit</code> button. When <code>submit</code>
        is clicked, it takes the field values and builds the query string just like
        before.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also added an event listener to the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object
        itself. This allows other code to continue executing while waiting for a
        response. When the response has loaded, we also added some error handling
        depending on the <code>status</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let’s give it a try.
    </p>

    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/form-response.png">

    <p>
        It works – but we’re back to the unformatted output like before. There’s a
        lot of information, so let’s decide what we’re interested in displaying.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let’s include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Web URL
        </li>
        <li>
            Headline
        </li>
        <li>
            Snippet
        </li>
        <li>
            Publication date
        </li>
        <li>
            Images
        </li>
    </ul>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/Hapachino/xjcprehn/2/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p>
        And the results:
    </p>

    <img class="thumbnail" src="img/form-formatted.png">

    <p>
        Looking good! The headlines also serve as links to the original article. With some 
        nicer formatting, this could almost pass as a real content site! 
    </p>

    <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block" href="articleAPI.html" target="_blank">Try It!</a>
 
    <h2 class="page-header" id="9">Top Stories API</h2>

    <p>
        Let’s try one of the other New York Time API’s – the 
        <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/top_stories_v2.json#">Top Stories API</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We follow the same steps as before and start with examining the
        <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/top_stories_v2.json#/README">documentation</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We only have three parameters this time - <code>section</code>,
        <code>response-format</code>, and <code>api-key</code>. One thing to note is
        that the first two parameters are part of the endpoint, rather than the
        query string like before.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once again, let’s examine a sample response format with our JSON formatter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="img/formatted-top-stories.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        It looks pretty similar to before. Once again we have an object with some
        meta information and a <code>results</code> array containing,
        unsurprisingly, the results. Let’s expand the first one to see what
        information we are interested in extracting and how to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="img/first-top-stories.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        Great – now we can easily modify our previous code to work with the new
        API by revising the request and how we interpret the response.
